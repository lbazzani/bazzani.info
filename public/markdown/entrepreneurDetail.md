Founded and scaled multiple technology startups, experiencing firsthand the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship.

## Entrepreneurial Journey

### Building from Scratch
Starting a company teaches lessons that can't be learned anywhere else. From initial concept to product-market fit, every step requires:

- **Vision**: Seeing opportunities where others see obstacles
- **Resilience**: Bouncing back from setbacks and failures
- **Adaptability**: Pivoting when necessary while staying true to core values
- **Leadership**: Inspiring teams during uncertain times

### Key Learnings

**Product-Market Fit**
Understanding customer needs deeply and iterating rapidly to deliver real value. The journey from idea to product that people love is rarely linear.

**Team Building**
Hiring the right people, creating a positive culture, and empowering teams to do their best work. The team makes or breaks a startup.

**Resource Management**
Operating with limited resources forces creativity and prioritization. Every decision matters when resources are scarce.

**Customer Focus**
Staying close to customers, listening to feedback, and building relationships that last beyond transactions.

### The Startup Mindset

The entrepreneurial experience shaped my approach to all work:
- Move fast and iterate
- Focus on outcomes, not activities
- Embrace uncertainty
- Learn from failures
- Stay customer-obsessed

These lessons about product-market fit, team building, and resilience in the face of uncertainty continue to guide my work today.
