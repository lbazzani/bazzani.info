I love to create, invent, and experiment. In over thirty years I've worked with at least 10 different programming languages.

## Software Engineering Passion

### The Joy of Creation
There's something magical about building software - taking an idea and turning it into something tangible that people can use. This passion has driven me for over three decades.

### Continuous Learning

**30+ Years of Evolution**
The technology landscape has changed dramatically over my career:

- **1990s**: Desktop applications, early web technologies
- **2000s**: Web 2.0, AJAX, mobile revolution
- **2010s**: Cloud computing, microservices, DevOps
- **2020s**: AI/ML, serverless, edge computing

Through all these changes, the excitement of learning something new has never faded.

### Polyglot Programming

**10+ Programming Languages**
Working with diverse languages provides different perspectives on problem-solving:

- **Low-level**: C, C++ for performance-critical systems
- **Enterprise**: Java, C# for large-scale applications
- **Scripting**: Python, JavaScript for rapid development
- **Modern**: Go, Rust for cloud-native solutions
- **Functional**: Exploring different programming paradigms

Each language teaches something new about computer science and software design.

### Hands-On Approach

**Personal Testing Philosophy**
I enjoy personally testing everything that's new and innovative:

- Building proof-of-concepts
- Experimenting with new frameworks
- Contributing to open source
- Staying current with industry trends

### The Maker Mindset

Whether it's a weekend project or a production system, the process of:
1. **Ideation**: Imagining what's possible
2. **Design**: Planning the architecture
3. **Implementation**: Writing the code
4. **Iteration**: Refining and improving

...remains endlessly fascinating. This hands-on approach keeps skills sharp and perspective fresh, even while managing teams and strategy.

The combination of deep technical knowledge and genuine enthusiasm for technology enables effective technical leadership and mentorship.
