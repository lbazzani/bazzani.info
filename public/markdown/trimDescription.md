1999 - 2016

Starting in 1999, I co-founded three companies with classmates within the business incubator at Politecnico di Torino. My passion for computer science, entrepreneurial spirit, and creativity were the driving forces behind the group, which has achieved over â‚¬3 million in annual revenue with consistent growth over its nearly twenty-year history.
